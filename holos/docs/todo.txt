----------------------------------------------------------------------
major missing features from axonlib, in no particular order
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* the rest of the parameters from axonlib
  [generally done?]

* --"-- widgets --"--

* ladspa
  [in progress]

* /test: directory with small(-ish) test apps, individually testing
  the holos features. and, if possible, a way to run all tests,
  route all output to file, and compare with a "master" ???

----------------------------------------------------------------------
code
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* namespace (?)

  wrap everything in a 'holos' namespace? 'using holos;'
  to avoid polluting the global namespace?

* h_ prefix

  add a h_ or H_ prefix to absolutely everything?
  again to avoid name collisions with our other code,
  a lib-users plugin code, or external libraries..

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ideas
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* h_DefaultEditor, parses parameters, set up a default gui, a bit like how a
  host would create an editor, if your plugin doesn't provide its own.
  this can be skinned, and made more 'exciting' :-), added features, etc..

  additionally, there could be a constructor that takes a ptr to an array
  of widget descriptions/info.. a bit like how we were discussing about
  parameters, and the possibility of defining them in a struct..

* opengl, glx/wgl

  a h_Texture representing a pbuffer (render target in video card memory),
  this pbuffer can be created from a h_Surface or h_Window.
  hardware acceleration might be a little problematic,
  depending on screen vs surface color-depth/format..

* program dumping

  a dummPrograms() function that writes out a .h file that we can
  directly include in our plugin

----------------------------------------------------------------------
known (?) major bugs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* [partially fixed???]
  in a dual-display setup in linux, if i drag the editor window to the
  other screen than energy xt2, close it, and try to re-open it, x
  freezes completely, and i have to do a AltGr-SysRq-K to kill x.
  i think it might have something to do with opening a Display connection
  on a different screen than the parent Window.
  idea: check createwindow/parent, and reparent()
  update: might be fixed.. too early to say yet..
