V. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

  Q: What notable restrictions are there in the Holos Library License?
  A:
  - You cannot include the source code in a binary distribution if you are
  selling it, but you must always make it available for users
  (e.g. via download).
  - Any modifications you have made on The Library should be released under
  the Holos Library License. Please read III. 7, 8.
  - You should not change the origin of the files contained in The Library.  
  - You must notify of the use of The Library in all projects.
  Please read III. 2, 3.  
  
  Q: Is it OK to use the VST SDK with this Library?
  A: If you are using the Library with the VST SDK you should read the
  Steinberg VST PlugIns SDK Licensing Agreement as you are not permitted
  to modify the VST SDK or redistribute it. The VST SDK is also NOT FULLY
  COMPATIBLE with the GNU GPL and therefore with a version of the Library
  released under GPL (You cannot distribute binaries based on GPL code if you
  do not distribute ALL the source code for them). Same does not apply if the
  Library uses HLL.
        
  Q: Can I use this Library for my commercial binaries?
  A: Yes, but you can only add value to binaries and sell them. You also must
  provide a download location for ABSOLUTELY ALL the source code that was used
  to create such. Please read III. 5, 6, 7.
  
  Q: Can i use LGPL or GPL code with The Library?
  A: Yes you can. HLL also permits a (L)GPL copy/snapshot of of the Library to
  be released at any given moment, but you will have to change the licensing
  condition in all The Library files. Please read III. 7, 8, 9.
  
  Q: Is HLL a viral license like GPL?
  A: No. Adding files to a HLL project distribution will not enforce the
  license on them, but for a binary product the non-HLL licensed files will
  have to be made available as well, otherwise there will be a violation
  of the HLL licensing agreement. Please read III. 6.
  
  Q: Is HLL code compatible with MIT code for example?
  A: Yes. HLL should be compatible with most known licenses, unless for example
  one has a condition to FORCE the users to make their code closed source. 

  Q: Can I use the HLL with my own library?
  A: Yes. Just modify the lines on top of this document (section I) stating the
  authors, project name and project web page. You should also copy and modify
  the copyright notice from section IV in all files that are part of
  your library.
  
  Q: Where can I ask more questions?
  A: Please visit http://holos.googlecode.com/
