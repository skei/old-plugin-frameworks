IV. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q: Can I use this Library for my commercial binaries?
A: Yes, you can, under the restrictions of the Axonlib License.
   The License adds a permissive Exception to the LGPL license. You can link
   library derivatives (binary) statically and/or dynamically to any program
   and distribute them commercially.

Q: What notable restrictions are there in the AXL ?
A: - For commercial binaries you cannot include any source code from the
     library. Please read 3. of the Exception notice.

   - Any modifications you have made on the Library should be released under
     the Axonlib License, the GPL or the LGPL (Please read 6. and 7. of the
     Exception notice).

   - If you are releasing the source code modifications under the Axonlib
     License the files LICENSE_AX, LICENSE_AXDOCS and PREAMBLE should
     also be present.

   - You must notify of the use of the Library for all projects. See III.4.
     for details.

Q: Can i use LGPL or GPL code with the Library?
A: Yes you can. You are allowed to modify the Library files to be released
   under GPL or LGPL, but you will have to change the licensing condition.
   Please read 6. and 7. of the Exception notice.

Q: Is it OK to use the VST SDK with this Library?
A: If you are using the Library with the VST SDK you should read the
   Steinberg VST PlugIns SDK Licensing Agreement as you are not permitted
   to modify the VST SDK or redistribute it. The VST SDK is also NOT FULLY
   COMPATIBLE with the GNU GPL and therefore with a version of the Library
   released under GPL (You cannot distribute binaries based on GPL code if you
   do not distribute ALL the source code for them). Same does not apply if the
   Library uses AXL.

Q: Can I use AXL with my own projects?
A: Yes, you can, but you have to:
   - Include copies of the files LGPL, GPL, PREAMBLE, LICENSE_AX and
     LICENSE_AXDOCS
   - Once in your own project, modify the top of the LICENSE_AX and
     LICENSE_AXDOCS and PREAMBLE to change the year, copyright holders and
     project name.
   - Add license notifications (section V.) in all source code files that
     are part of your library.

Q: Is AXL code compatible with MIT code for example?
A: Yes. As an extension of the LGPL, AXL is compatible with most known
   licenses. Please read more info on LGPL compatibility with other licenses.

Q: Where can I ask more questions?
A: Please visit http://axonlib.googlecode.com/
