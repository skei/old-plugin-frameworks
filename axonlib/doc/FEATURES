list of feature for axonlib v.0.1.0

OVERVIEW:
* binary format abstraction for vst plugins and excutables on linux and windows
* common look, feel, functionality among platforms
* few external dependencies
* compile scripts with simplified command lines for the gnu gcc compiler
* tiny and compact binaries with no big, external libraries needed
* cpu efficient, code prepared for compiler analysis and optimization
* options to disable code or functionality that is not needed
* flexible axl license, (generally gpl w/ exception for proprietary use)

CORE:
* builtin fast memory allocator routines (and leak detection functionality)
* builtin routines for low-level string and memory manipulation
* heavily optimized mathematical functions and approximations
* intuitive debugging functionality & helpers
* static and runtime assertion

GUI:
* hierarchial gui, flexible, skinnable, auto-layout, sizeable, moveable etc
* resizeable window/editor (in plugin hosts as well)
* low level gfx (gdi/xlib) canvas, surface, bitmap etc
* partial support for antialiased, transparent lines
* support decoding 32bit pngs from memory or from an external file
* scalable,alpha blended bitmaps
* mouse cursor shapes, hovering hints, mouse capture, modal widgets

DSP:
* polyphonic voice manager and event scheduler
* modular audio graph with connectable dsp modules
* rbj filter bank
* basic oversampling container
* chamberlin state variable filter
* rms approximation
* envelope follower
* basic waveform generators

PLUGINS:
* lots of included example vst plugins
* simplified creation and use of parameters
* easy host tempo/sync handling for audio and midi
* can load external files directly from plugin
  folder on both linux and windows

OTHER:
* basic read/write access for external files
* utility methods for bit manipulation and conversations
* scripts, stack-based, 4th inspired, rudimentary compilation (bytecode)
* builtin, random number generators
* mersenne twister implementation, customized for small binary size impact
* fft implementation
* more...
