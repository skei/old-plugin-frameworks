1) Legal
========

Source code may be freely used for any purpose, including commercial
applications. Programs must display in their "About" dialog-box (or
documentation if such a feature doesn't exist) a text telling they use
these routines by Laurent de Soras. Modified source code can be distributed,
but modifications must be clearly indicated.



2) Content
==========

There is no official web site where to get these files. If you have them,
that's all to the good for you.

You should find in this package the following files:
- readme.txt
- FFTReal.cpp
- FFTReal.h
- test.cpp



3) Usage
========

Just instanciate one time a FFTReal object. The constructor precompute a lot
of things, so it can be long. The parameter is the number of points used for
the next FFTs. It must be a power of 2:

   FFTReal  fft_object (1024);   // 1024-point FFT object constructed.

Then you can use this object to compute as many FFTs and IFFTs as you want.
They will be computed very quickly because a lot of work has been done in the
object construction.

   flt_t x [1024];
   flt_t f [1024];

   ...
   fft_object.do_fft (f, x);     // x --FFT---> f
   ...
   fft_object.do_ifft (f, x);    // f --IFFT--> x
   fft_object.rescale (x);       // Post-scaling should be done after FFT+IFFT
   ...

x [] and f [] are floating point number arrays. flt_t is a predefined type
mapped to float. You can change it in FFTReal.h if you want to compute FFTs on
double or long double numbers.

x [] is the real number sequence which we want to compute the FFT. f [] is the
result, in the frequency domain. f has the same number of elements as x [],
but f [] elements are complex numbers. The routine uses some FFT properties to
optimize memory and to reduce calculations : the transformaton of a real
number sequence is a conjugate complex number sequence : F [k] = F [-k]*.

The following table shows how the f [] sequence is mapped onto the usable FFT
coefficients (called bins) :

   f [0]          : Real (bin 0)
   f [...]        : Real (bin ...)
   f [length/2]   : Real (bin length/2)
   f [length/2+1] : Imag (bin 1)
   f [...]        : Imag (bin ...)
   f [length-1]   : Imag (bin length/2-1)

And FFT bins are distributed in f [] as above:

   Bin         | Real part      | Imaginary part 
   ------------+----------------+----------------
   0           | f [0]          | 0
   1           | f [1]          | f [length/2+1]
   ...         | f [...],       | f [...]
   length/2-1  | f [length/2-1] | f [length-1]
   length/2    | f [length/2]   | 0
   length/2+1  | f [length/2-1] | - f [length-1]
   ...         | f [...]        | - f [...]
   length-1    | f [1]          | - f [length/2+1]

f [] coefficients have the same layout for FFT and IFFT functions. You may
notice that scaling must be done if you want to retrieve x after FFT and IFFT.
Actually, IFFT (FFT (x)) = x * length(x). This is a not a problem because
most of the applications don't care about absolute values. Thus, the operation
requires less calculation. If you want to use the FFT and IFFT to transform a
signal, you have to apply post- (or pre-) processing yourself. Multiplying
or dividing floating point numbers by a power of 2 doesn't generate extra
computation noise.



4) Implementation notes
=======================

These FFT routines are optimized for Intel Pentium II compatible processors.
However, they should work fine on every other types of processor.

You should also activate the exception handling of your compiler to get the
class memory-leak-safe. Thus, when a memory allocation fails (in the
constructor), an exception is thrown and the entire object is safely
destructed. It reduces the permanent error checking overhead in the client
code.



5) History
==========

v1.03, 2001.06.15

- Thanks to Frederic Vanmol for the Pascal port (works with Delphi).
- Documentation improvement

v1.02, 2001.03.25

- sqrt() is now precomputed when the object FFTReal is constructed, resulting
in speed impovement for small size FFT.

v1.01, 2000.??.??

- Small modifications, I don't remember what.

v1.00, 1999.08.14

- First version released
